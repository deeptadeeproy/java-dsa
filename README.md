## Java DSA Practice

This repository is a dedicated space for practicing and implementing core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts using **Java**.

It serves as a personal workbook to:

* **Build Foundational Understanding:** Implement classic data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees from scratch.
* **Master Key Algorithms:** Practice standard algorithms, including sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), searching (Binary Search), and graph traversal (BFS, DFS).
* **Solve Common Problems:** Store clean, categorized solutions to algorithmic problems often encountered in interviews and competitive programming.

The goal is clarity, correctness, and a deep understanding of $\mathbf{O(n)}$ Time and Space Complexity.
